Social Media Image Placeholders

For the Social Glimpse Carousel to display correctly, please add your social media post images to this directory.
You'll need the following files:

1. instagram-post1.jpg - An Instagram post preview
2. twitter-post1.jpg - A Twitter/X post preview
3. youtube-post1.jpg - A YouTube video thumbnail
4. behance-post1.jpg - A Behance project preview
5. linkedin-post1.jpg - A LinkedIn post preview

For best results:
- Use images with aspect ratio close to 1:1 (square) or 4:5
- Recommended size: at least 600x600px
- Image should be visually appealing and relevant to the content described in the post

If you don't have actual social media posts, you can use mockups or placeholder designs that represent the type of content you would post on each platform.
